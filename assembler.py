        Assembler class constructor.

        Initializes 7 important properties of the Assembler class:
        -   self.__address_symbol_table (dict): stores labels (scanned in the first pass)
            as keys and their locations as values.
        -   self.__bin (dict): stores locations (or addresses) as keys and the binary 
            representations of the instructions at these locations (job of the second pass) 
            as values.
        -   self.__asmfile (str): the file name of the assembly code file. This property
            is initialized and defined in the read_code() method.
        -   self.__asm (list): list of lists, where each outer list represents one line of 
            assembly code and the inner list is a list of the symbols in that line.
            for example:
                ORG 100
                CLE
            will yiels __asm = [['org', '100'] , ['cle']]
            Notice that all symbols in self.__asm are in lower case.
        -   self.__mri_table (dict): stores memory-reference instructions as keys, and their
            binary representations as values.
        -   self.__rri_table (dict): stores register-reference instructions as keys, and their
            binary representations as values.
        -   self.__ioi_table (dict): stores input-output instructions as keys, and their
            binary representations as values.
        
        Thie constructor receives four optional arguments:
        -   asmpath (str): path to the assembly code file.
        -   mripath (str): path to text file containing the MRI instructions. The file should
            include each intruction and its binary representation separated by a space in a
            separate line. Their must be no empty lines in this file.
        -   rripath (str): path to text file containing the RRI instructions. The file should
            include each intruction and its binary representation separated by a space in a
            separate line. Their must be no empty lines in this file.
        -   ioipath (str): path to text file containing the IOI instructions. The file should
            include each intruction and its binary representation separated by a space in a
            separate line. Their must be no empty lines in this file.
